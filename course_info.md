# First Steps Info

Welcome to First Steps! In this 10-session preparatory program, you will take your first steps in the world of coding by learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This course is a live, interactive class held online using the Zoom video platform. We provide you with live lectures, instructions on how to code, exercises, quizzes, and more. 

The First Steps course is designed for complete beginners who wish to get a taste of the coding world and for those who already applied to [ITC's fullstack web development program](https://www.itc.tech). By the end of this program, you will be able to build a nice personal web portfolio using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## [First Steps Course Information](#first-steps-course-information)

### Course Intro

We designed this First Steps program to prepare you for [ITC's fullstack web development program](https://www.itc.tech) where you can enter Israel's hi-tech industry. 

In this First Steps program, you will prepare by learning the basics of frontend development. If you continue to the fullstack program, you will level up your skills by diving into more advanced frontend topics and learning about backend web development. The backend learning in the fullstack program includes building servers, managing databases, and deploying your fullstack web applications live on the web. 

Those who are planning to apply to [ITC's fullstack web development program](https://www.itc.tech) will showcase the portfolio you build from this course in a short technical interview as part of the fullstack admissions process. 

[ITC's fullstack web development program](https://www.itc.tech) is three months of classroom work following by a two-month internship at a hi-tech company in Israel. To help prepare you for industry, in the fullstack program you also will learn how to use Git and Github, develop your soft skills, prepare for technical and non-technical interviews, compete in a hackathon, and more! 

### Zoom Class

Live classes are held over Zoom. If you haven't used Zoom, please create a free Zoom account and practice using it. Please know how to share your screen, mute and unmute your microphone, turn your camera on, and use the chat. Don't worry, it's easy!  

We will provide you with Zoom links for each lecture.

### Course Materials

For this First Steps program, you will use [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/u/1/c/MjU0NjEyNjE0MDcz) and [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/61113157-first-steps-feb-2021) to access course materials. We will post in the Google Classroom course materials for you that are hosted on Github Classroom. This material is here to guide you in your self-learning process after the live lessons.   

If you haven't already, please create a [Github Account](https://github.com/). It's the most popular code versioning and sharing platform for developers. In this course we will use it mainly for sharing materials with you. If you attend the fullstack program, you will learn how to work with Github as a developer.

### Course Communication

To communicate with your classmates and with staff, please use Slack. While the staff will try its best to provide a timely response, we oftentimes can't provide real-time communication. Therefore, if you have a question about course materials, schedule, a technical issue or anything, asking it to the Slack Classroom instead of messaging staff directly can result in a faster response because oftentimes one or more of your fellow classmates knows the answer and can respond quicker than staff. 

By asking your question to the group, not only do you have more potential people who can answer, other students in class might need the same answers as you. You'll be impressed by how classroom communication between students can accelerate your learning and show you new ways to write code and solve technical issues. 

If something is private, you can of course approach the staff privately.  

### Live Session Behavior

To maximize the course's potential, we respectfully request a few things from you during the live sessions. First, be in the classroom at least 5 minutes before the session starts, whether it be in person or by video. We will start on time and end on time. But to do so, we need to minimize unnecessary distractions.  

Second, please be patient with your questions during the live sessions. To help keep a good rhythm and pace, we will reserve specific times during the live sessions for questions rather than take them as they come. 

Third, please keep your camera on and your mic muted unless you're talking to the class. We ask you to have your camera on because the classroom experience is much better when we can see each other. We ask you to mute your mic to minimize distractions.  

Fourth, take an active role in the live sessions and Slack Classroom discussions. We recommend you download the Google Classroom and Slack Apps. Class communication is important to us for several reasons. In web development, most often there's not a single right approach or solution to a technical. Rather, multiple solutions exist, each with different pros and cons. Moreover, oftentimes you'll get stuck on something and need some guidance. By having an active classroom discussion, you can learn from your classmates.

### Have Fun

We insist that you have fun and enjoy the process! Learning to code can be extremely rewarding, personally and professionally. Though it also can have its frustrating momements. While learning to code, be patient and persistent during those frustrating moments. To help get you through them, practice becoming a creative problem-solver, a clever architect of solutions, and curious about the tools available to you.
