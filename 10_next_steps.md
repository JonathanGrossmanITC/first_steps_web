# Next Steps  

In this lesson, you review the JavaScript quiz, learn about ITC's Fullstack Program, and do some live coding and demo challenges. 

First, we will briefly review the JavaScript quiz questions and answers to reinforce what you learned in the JavaScript lessons. Then, you will receive an overview of the ITC Fullstack Program. This overview will tell you what the program is like, what kind of unique experiences you'll have, the technologies you'll learn, and types of people you'll meet.

Finally, you will spend the rest of the time doing a live group build session, taking turns explaining code and answering technical questions, and other interactive activities that recap what you've learned so far. 

Come prepared to participate, have fun, and cooperate to learn new things.

This lesson consists of the following:

Hour 1: [QUIZ JavaScript](#quiz-javascript)  
Hour 2: [Overview](#itc-overview) of ITC Fullstack Program and JS Online Resources  
Hour 3: [Live Coding Challenge](#live-coding-challenge)  

You do not have any written materials for this session. However, we are sending you off with some links that can help you prepare for ITC's Fullstack program or otherwise take your skills to the next level.
